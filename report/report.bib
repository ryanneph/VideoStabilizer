abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for automatically applying constrainable, L1-optimal camera paths to generate stabilized videos by removing undesired motions. Our goal is to compute camera paths that are composed of constant, linear and parabolic segments mimicking the camera motions employed by professional cinematographers. To this end, our algorithm is based on a linear programming framework to minimize the first, second, and third derivatives of the resulting camera path. Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos. Our approach accomplishes this without the need of user interaction or costly 3D reconstruction of the scene, and works as a post-process for videos from any camera or from an online source.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to stabilize video sequences based on a 3D perspective camera model. Compared to previous methods which are based on simplified models, our stabilization system can work in situations where significant depth variations exist in the scenes and the camera undergoes large translational movement. We formulate the stabilization problem as a quadratic cost function on smoothness and similarity constraints. This allows us to precisely control the smoothness by solving a sparse linear system of equations. By taking advantage of the sparseness, our optimization process is very efficient. Instead of recovering dense depths, we use approximate geometry representation and analyze the resulting warping errors. We show that by appropriately constraining warping error, visually plausible results can be achieved even using planar structures. A variety of experiments have been implemented, which demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision. Unfortunately, traditional image registration techniques tend to be costly. We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show show our technique can be adapted for use in a stereo vision system. 2. The registration problem The translational image registration problem can be characterized as follows: We are given functions F(x) and G(x) which give the respective pixel values at each location x in two images, where x is a vector. We wish to find the disparity vector h which minimizes some measure of the difference between F(x + h) and G(x), for x in some region of interest R. (See figure 1). 1.},

abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an ex- tension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising nu- merical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude. Key},
